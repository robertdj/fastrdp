The *fastrdp* package contains an implementation of the [Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm) for reducing the number of points in a curve.


# Example

There is a single function in the *fastrdp* package.
Here is an example from the Wikipedia page linked to above with a description of the algorithm.
The original line is black and the approximating line is red.

```{python example}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import fastrdp

x = np.linspace(0, 5, 10_000)
y = np.exp(-x) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x)
x_new, y_new = fastrdp.rdp(x, y, 0.06)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y, color='black', linewidth=2.0)
ax.plot(x_new, y_new, linestyle='dashed', color='red')
plt.show()
```


# Performance

Here we compare the performance of *fastrdp* with that of a pure Python implementation.
The example above is executed with *fastrdp* in less than a millisecond on my machine 

```{python performance_fastrdp}
from timeit import timeit
timeit(lambda: fastrdp.rdp(x, y, 0.1), number=10_000)
```

The pure Python implementation in the [*rdp* package](https://pypi.org/project/rdp) takes more than a second to finish the same computation

```{python performance_rdp}
import rdp
z = np.column_stack((x, y))
timeit(lambda: rdp.rdp(z, epsilon=0.1), number=1)
```


To illustrate how *fastrdp* scales consider the following graph that shows execution time for an increasing number of random input points.
The figure is produced with the scripts in the `performance` folder.

# Compilation

To specify package metadata *fastrdp* is using the contemporary `pyproject.toml`.
Execute the following commands to build and install *fastrdp*

```bash
pip install .
```

If you want an editable installation, then add a `-e` to the last command.
To also install the optional dependencies used for development add a little extra:

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

The single quotes are needed in zsh, but is perhaps superfluous in other shells.


# Acknowledgements

Setting up package metadata to build and compile *fastrdp* is inspired by the [pybind11 example package](https://github.com/pybind/python_example).
